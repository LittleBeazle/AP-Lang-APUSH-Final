    <h3>What steps did the Bostic family take to get to East Tennessee?</h3>

  <div class="box-entry apush-text">
    <h3>Origins of the Bostics</h3>
    <p>The first certain record of the Bostic (also known as Bostock, Bostick, etc.) family comes from the county of Cheshire in England, where a man named Arthur Bostock was baptized in 1603. He emigrated to the New World around 1640. He was likely seeking religious freedom, as he was a devout Puritan Catholic. He settled in Virginia, where he had at least one child named Charles Bostick.</p>

    <h3>From Virginia to North Carolina</h3>
    <p>The Bostick family resided in Virginia through three generations until one William Bostic, son of William Bostick, was recorded as having died in Person, North Carolina in 1792. The Bosticks remained in North Carolina until Obediah Bostick, who was born in Halifax, Virginia in 1965, moved with his parent, Keziah Bostick, to Virginia and settled down there. Keziah died in North Carolina. Obediah died in 1825 in Russell, Virginia and his son, Caleb Bostic, lived and died in the very same town.</p>

    <h3>Arriving in Tennessee</h3>
    <p>Valentine Miller Bostic, son of Caleb Bostic, is the first Bostic to have been recorded as living in Tennessee. He was born in Russell, Virginia in 1834 and died in Claiborne, Tennessee in 1879. He sired a boy named Howard Felix Bostic, born in 1872 in Claiborne, Tennessee. Howard had a son, Harrison Valentine Bostic, in Claiborne and died in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1939.</p>

    <h3>Harrison Bostic and the Path to Jacksboro</h3>
    <p>Harrison Valentine Bostic is the person who, of all the Bostic ancestors, has the most well-known history among the members of the Bostic family who are still alive today since his history can be traced back through word-of-mouth stories from his children and grandchildren who are still alive. After being born in Claiborne, Tennessee in 1892, Harrison eventually eloped with Roxie Sharp and together they traveled over the mountain. They settled down in the Norris Basin and had several children before being forced to relocate some time before 1936 due to the construction of Norris Dam by the Tennessee Valley Authority. They moved from the Norris Basin to LaFollette, Tennessee and had several more children. One of these children was Jesse Ray Bostic, my grandfather. Born in 1934, Jesse eventually moved to the nearby town of Jacksboro and had my father and three other sons. One of these sons moved to Farragut, Tennessee while the rest, including my father, currently live with their families in Jacksboro, Tennessee.</p>
